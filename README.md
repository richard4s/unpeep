#Landing page for unpeep
###Just like the branch says, this is actually the landing page for unpeep ðŸ˜Š.
###I wouldn't advice you to look for much here considering how you got here anyway because this is not the master branch and would soon be forgotten.
###If you haven't already notice, this is a landing page.Therefore you would need to do the following...
* Hopefully, you have [<b>xampp</b>] from (https://www.apachefriends.org/) or good 'ol apache
* Download and install [<b>composer</b>] from (https://getcomposer.org)
* After, you've properly installed composer. Open your terminal and run `composer install` or `composer update`
* Install laravel by running `composer require "laravel/installer"`in your terminal
* Create your `.env` in the root directory of the project and copy everything from the `.env.example` file into it
* Change your database details in the `.env file`
* Run `php artisan key:generate` in your terminal
* Run `php artisan migrate:install` in your terminal
* And then run `php artisan serve` in your terminal when its done
* Voila ðŸ™Œ, you have our landing page. Don't forget to leave a star in our [github page] (https://github.com/richad4s/unpeep) ðŸ¥³
