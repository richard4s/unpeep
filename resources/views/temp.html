Is a reproduced photograph still&nbsp;<a href="http://thehhub.com/2018/11/30/the-importance-of-quality-vs-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: currentcolor;">art</a>, or is the title of “art” reserved for the original?&nbsp;</span>
    <span style="box-sizing: inherit;">A poster of Klimt’s “The Kiss” hanging in millions of dorm rooms nationwide is not the same as seeing the original painting hung in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere Museum in Vienna, but is the same true of a photograph?</span>

At this point, &nbsp;Jones’ colleague Sean O’Hagan had enough of Jones’ opinions (or perhaps the whole debate was orchestrated by The Guardian to get people talking, which it did). O’Hagan penned a counterpoint article of his own titled</span>
    <span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;“Photography is Art and Always Will Be</span><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">.”</span></p>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">O’Hagan argues that&nbsp;</span><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">“</span><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">Photography is as vibrant as it has ever been — more so in response to the digital world, which Jonathan mistakenly thinks has made everyone a great photographer. It hasn’t. It has made it easy for people to take — and disseminate — photographs, that’s all. A great photographer can make a great photograph whatever the camera. A bad one will still make a bad photograph on a two grand digital camera that does everything for you. It’s about a way of seeing, not technology.”</span></p>

Some critics loved the show, including The Art Journal (published April 1st, 1858), which said,</span></p>

The Guardian’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/19/photography-is-it-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: currentcolor;">article</a>&nbsp;on the 1858 exhibit details how one of the members of the Photographic Society of London (est. 1953) said the new technique (photography) was “</span>

There has to be an element, in all art, of exceptional skill, of something being done with awesome craftsmanship. But an artist who is only a craftsman is only a craftsman.&nbsp;</span>
    <span style="box-sizing: inherit;">Art must have form, it must have meaning — like science, art is a way of knowing the world, of giving form and meaning to a society that often seems formless.</span>

This type of photojournalism may be edited in post-production, but its intention is documentation, not art; it is a record of the past and does not intend to present a creative vision.</span></p>

While you might happen to capture an incredible scene on your way to work, your photo can’t be considered art unless it has been changed in some way by your intelligence and thought process. However, this doesn’t mean that artistic photography can only be achieved with complex staging and lighting or digital effects; in fact, some of the most artistic photos ever taken have been landscapes, for example, the work of Ansel Adams</span>

Fine art photography is often described as having the opposite intention of photojournalism. While the two share the same equipment (i.e a camera), their intentions are drastically different.</span></p>

Stay with me. While the two share milk as their main ingredient, the final product is so different that it would be fruitless to compare the two. It makes little sense to compare photojournalism and fine art photography.</span></p>

In the late 19th century, modernist photographer Alfred Stieglitz worked alongside his wife, Georgia O’Keefe, to push for the movement of photography into museums. It was considered revolutionary when, in the early 20th century, his photographs were shown alongside paintings in the Special Exhibition of Contemporary Art organized by the National Arts Club.</span></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">In 1924, Stieglitz donated 27 photographs to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which was the first time a major museum accepted photography into its permanent collection. Steiglitz belief in his own photograph as art was unwavering.

The article claims Steiglitz wrote in a letter to Hart Crane in 1923, “</span><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">I know exactly what I have photographed. I know I have done something that has never been done</span><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">.”</span></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">The inclusion of photography in a fine art museum paved the way for photographers like Paul Strand, Man Ray, Diane Arbus, Cindy Sherman, Richard Avedon and of course, Ansel Adams.</span></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">Adams, not surprisingly, fought fiercely against the notion that photography was not art.</span></p><blockquote style="box-sizing: inherit; padding-left: 1rem; padding-right: 1rem; font-size: 1.125em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">“I don’t know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.” – Ansel Adams</span></p></blockquote><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">Adams also once stated, “</span><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">Art implies control of reality, for reality itself possesses no sense of aesthetic.

The notion that anyone can be a photographer is outdated at best. It is true insofar that anyone with a paintbrush can be a painter, anyone with a laptop, a writer.

Easier said than done, but the more you practice, the more innate your photography skills become. In this flow is where the art lives.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">Instead of worrying about making art, think of working to improve your craft. It may take time until you have a body of work that you feel clearly expresses your point of view as an artist. It can help to write an artistic statement, one for your eyes only. This will help you to clearly define, in words, what you are showing through your photos, what your work means, and why it is important. Think of your photos as your voice. What is important to you? Why this particular image? Why now?</span></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">Practice regularly, and don’t judge yourself for making art that you don’t love.</span><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;Oh, and&nbsp;<a href="https://thehhub.com/2018/10/11/its-okay-to-break-the-rules-in-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: currentcolor;">ignore</a>&nbsp;critics.</span></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(22, 22, 22); font-size: 21.0006px;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit;">If your work brings happiness, comfort, a new perspective to even one viewer, then it is art.
